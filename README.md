This is a tutorialproject based on a game that was created by me for the GMTK Game Jam 2019.
The main goal lies in recreating a small part of the game. Goals include:
- creating nodes and adding them to a scene
- adding scripts to nodes
- changing node properties with scripts
- using signals

A completed version of the project can be found in the 'completed'-branch.
New games can be added as long as the root node of the new game scene has a script with the method 'end_game()' and a 'game_over' signal.
